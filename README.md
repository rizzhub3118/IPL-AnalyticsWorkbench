# 🏏 IPL Analytics Workbench

An interactive, end-to-end IPL analytics web application built using **Python, Pandas, Plotly, and Streamlit**.  
The application is designed as a **data analytics product**, with a strong focus on correct cricket logic, clean UX, and meaningful analytical separation.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The IPL Analytics Workbench provides two distinct analytical modes:

1. **Team-based season analytics** for contextual performance insights  
2. **Global batter vs bowler matchup analysis** across all IPL seasons  

The app intentionally separates these modes to avoid biased or misleading insights and to mirror how real-world sports analytics tools are designed.

## ✨ Key Features

### 📊 Team Analytics Mode
- Season-wise and team-wise filtering
- Core team KPIs:
  - Matches played
  - Runs scored
  - Wickets taken
- Phase-wise run analysis:
  - Powerplay
  - Middle Overs
  - Death Overs
- Batter performance lab with phase-based scoring insights
- Bowler performance lab with economy rate and wicket analysis

### ⚔️ Batter vs Bowler Matchup Mode
- Independent, global analysis across **all IPL seasons (2008–2025)**
- Head-to-head batter vs bowler statistics
- Phase-wise breakdown of matchup performance
- Implemented as a standalone analytical view, separate from team context

### 🎨 Interactive User Experience
- Dynamic team-based theme colors
- Smooth UI transitions and animations
- Tab-based navigation for structured exploration
- Analyst-first interface inspired by professional sports analytics platforms

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy
- Clear separation between **contextual team analytics** and **global player matchups**
- Role-based filtering to maintain accurate cricket logic
- Avoidance of misleading aggregations
- Emphasis on clarity, usability, and real-world analytical reasoning

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Plotly**
- **Streamlit**

---

## 📂 Dataset
The application uses a ball-by-ball IPL dataset covering seasons from **2008 to 2025**.

Due to GitHub file size limitations, the dataset is **not included** in this repository.  
This is a standard and intentional practice for projects involving large analytical datasets.
